# Pokémon Showdown Mod

The aim of this mod is to allow for easier Pokémon Stadium 2 battles using the original movesets of the Rental Pokémon.

# Features to be Implemented

**Movepools**: Each Pokemon, in addition to having their respective Pokémon Stadium 1 (if applicable) and 2 movesets, will be given a Movepool of 6-10 Moves. When the trainer chooses the Pokémon for their team, they may choose the Movepool at the same time, or use the default Moveset.

**Physical vs Special Handling**: Players may choose how to handle Typing. In the first three Generations of Pokémon, a moves form as Physical or Special was determined solely by its Type. This led to some bizarre interactions, such as all Ghost-Type moves being Physical in nature. Later Generations fixed this by deciding whether moves were Physical or Special on a move-by-move basis.

**Roster Inclusions**: Players may choose Pokémon, or groups of Pokémon, to ban from a rulelist. Examples of this would be if players felt like a certain Pokémon was overpowered, or wanted to only be able to use Gen2 Pokémon, or only non-Legendaries, etc. At some point, I plan to implement Gen3 Pokémon into this game, and from my feedback so far, this is a fairly divisive Generation, so some players may want to only play with Gens 1 and 2.

**Happiness Handling**: Moves such as Frustration and Return rely on a Pokémon's happiness level to determine their Base Power. In Pokémon Stadium 2, this was handled by giving all Rental Pokémon a below-average Happiness score, meaning Frustration would have a slightly higher Base Power than Return. Players may choose to keep the existing Pokémon Stadium 2 ruling on this, or they may customise default Happiness levels. Players may also choose to elect for the moves to ignore Happiness levels and default to a certain Base Power (though the only use case for this I can think of is if both Return and Frustration are usable in the same battle).

**EV/IV**: My goal for this project is to balance all Pokémon, allowing even "prevolutions" to be viable. One way to accomplish this is through the use of EVs and IVs; by giving the "prevolutions" much larger EVs and IVs than their evolutionary counterparts, the stats will remain roughly equal. Players may choose to use my altered EV/IV spreads for Pokémon, or they may choose to use the EV/IV spreads from Pokémon Stadium 1 or 2.
